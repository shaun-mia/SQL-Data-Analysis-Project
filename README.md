### SQL Data Analysis Project

Hello, everyone! I hope you’re having a wonderful day. In this repository, I’m excited to share some of the SQL data analysis projects I’ve worked on. These projects highlight my skills in using SQL to extract, clean, and analyze data.

I aim to showcase my ability to tackle real-world data challenges and provide insights through effective analysis. Each project includes detailed code and documentation to help you understand the processes involved. 

I hope that my work can be a useful resource for your own projects and coding journey. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!

Thank you for checking out my projects!
